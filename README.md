👋 Welcome to my coding universe! I'm Babacar, a results-driven software engineer dedicated to crafting exceptional web applications that leave a lasting impact.

💻 Frontend Development: I excel in delivering seamless user experiences (UX) through my expertise in HTML, SCSS, Webpack, JavaScript (JS), and TypeScript (TS). With a strong command of Angular 2, I architect scalable and intuitive web applications that resonate with users.

⚙️ Backend Development: My proficiency extends to backend technologies, including NestJS, ExpressJS, and Laravel. I leverage my deep understanding of HTTP protocols to design secure and efficient server-side architectures, empowering web applications with robust functionality.

🚀 CI/CD: I prioritize collaboration and version control using GitLab, where I orchestrate seamless workflows. Docker allows me to containerize applications, simplifying deployment, and maintaining consistency. Through YAML pipelines, I automate build, test, and deployment processes. DigitalOcean and Heroku serve as my preferred platforms for hosting and deploying applications.

🧪 Software Testing: I am a staunch advocate for reliable software, investing time and effort in comprehensive testing. I utilize Jest for unit testing, supertest for integration testing, and implement end-to-end (e2e) testing to ensure optimal functionality and stability.

🔑 API Design: Adept in REST API design principles, I create well-structured APIs that incorporate load balancing strategies. Implementing industry-standard practices like JWT and Passport, I ensure secure authentication and authorization for seamless access control.

🗄️ Database Management: My expertise spans multiple databases, including MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB. Leveraging powerful ORMs such as TypeORM, Sequelize, and Mongoose, I streamline database operations and optimize data management processes.

☁️ Amazon Web Services: Proficient in Amazon Web Services (AWS), I harness the full potential of EC2 for scalable computing, S3 for secure object storage, Lambda for serverless functions, and RDS for efficient database management. This enables me to deploy and manage applications in a cloud-native environment.

⚡️ I am passionate about continuous learning and staying abreast of emerging technologies and industry best practices. Let's collaborate to develop exceptional software solutions that drive innovation and exceed expectations.
